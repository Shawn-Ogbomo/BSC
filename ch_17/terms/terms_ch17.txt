address - location within the computers memory. In hexadecimal format. 

address of & - address of operator. Used to get the adress of an object 

allocation - alloting memory for an object 

cast - explicit conversion 

container - data structure. eg - vector, array 
contains multiple objects of the same type 
in contiguous regions of memory 

contentrs of * - used to dereference pointer types 

deallocation - returning memory for an allocated object 

delete - operator used to return memory to the free store for an object allocated using new 

delete[] - operator used to return memory to the free store where new[] was used

dereference - operator *  used to get contents of pointer type 

destructor - special function used to deallocate resource of class 

free store - heap memory (objects allocated using operator new )

link - type used to express the concept of list

list - prominent data structure. Holds information and pointers to other links 

member access -> - pointer member notation. Used to access members of a pointer type

member destructor - ~typename();

memory: satic memory, stack , or freestore 

memory leak- failing to use delete operator to deallocate object using new 

new - create an object using heap memory 

nullpointer - a pointer to a null address 

nullptr - used to initialize a pointer to a safe state 

pointer - an object that holds an address value 

range - total elements. Pointers do not know how many elements they are pointing to

resource leak - occurs when the destructor of a pointer type is not called.
Usually occurs when an exception is thrown. (dangling pointer)

subscripting- operator [] used to access a specific region of memory within the array type
