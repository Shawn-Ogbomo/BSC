//REVIEW

1, Why do we need data structures with varying array elements? - To prevent out of range errors - Account for users inputs

2, What are the four types of storage we have in a typical program?
-code storage
-when you start a c++ program, the compiler reserves memory for your code

    -static
      -for global variables you define

    -stack
        -functions
        -parameters
        -local variables

    -heap *free store*
        -memory allocated using operator new

3, What is the free store? What name is commonly used for it? - The free store is the heap memory in a program - Heap
-Supported operators
-new -delete

4, What is the dereference operator and why do we need one?
The dereference operator yields the data at a memory location
for a pointer type.

    dereference operator is required to manipulate the data of a pointer type and
    to retreive it.

5, What is an address? How are are memory addresses manipulated in c++?
An address is a memory location within the computers memory.
Memory addresses are manupulated in c++ using pointers and arrays

6, What information about a pointed-to object does a pointer have?
-Its location in memory
-its value
-size in bytes

    Pointers do contain a method to return the maximum number of elements within the pointer

7, What can a pointer point to? - A pointer can point to another pointer, or another object of the same type.

8, What is a leak? - A leak occurs when the programmer forgets to use the delete keyword to
manually deallocate memory that has been allocated using operator new.

9, What is a resource? - A resource is an object managed by a pointer type

10, How can we initialize a pointer?
Pointers are initialized using - nullptr - uniform initialization {}

11, What is a nullptr? When do we need to use one?

    -A nullptr is used to initialize of pointer to a safe state
    -nullptr means unknown memory location

    - pointer type can be used on objects to prevent a double delete
    - nullptr is used to prevent access of data at an unknown memory location

    -nullptr is used with selection to ensure that data is at an address before
    accessing it

12, When do we need a pointer (instead of a reference or a named object)? - Pointers are used to refer to multiple nullable objects or to manipulate them.

13, What is a destructor? When do we want one?
-A destructor is a spectial function that is called when invoking operator delete - assignment operator
-going out of scope
-End of program

    A destructor is required to return the allocated memery to the free store

14, When would we want a virual destructor?
-A virtual destructor is used with polymorphism (class with a virutal function)
-Virtual destructors ensure that all of the resources in the inheritance hierrarchy
are de-allocated.

15, How are destructors for members called?
-assignment operator
-going out of scope
-End of program
-invoking operator delete

16, What is a cast? When do we need to use one? - A cast is an explicit conversion - converts one type into a related type. Casts are required when we want to convert
a value to a related type

-eg, double to int

    We rarely want to use casts since they result in the loss of information
    Usually programs can be refractored to avoid the use of casts
    casts can result in implicit errors.

17, How do we access a member of a class through a pointer?
-Using the dereference operator \*

18, What is a doubly-linked list?

    - A doubly linked list is a list that holds a pointer to the previous link and the
    next link

19, What is this and why do we need to use it? - This is a pointer to the current object. - This is used to refer to the current object and is only used to refer to the entire object
